# Specification

## Use case

* The client should be able to connect to the server

* The server should be able to accept the connection from different clients at the same time

* The client should be able to send send a sequence of bytes, representing the number from 1 to 255 to the server

* The serve should be able to receive the sequence of bytes from the client

* The server should be able to send the sequence of bytes back to the client

* The client should be able to disconnect from the server

     * If read or write is called after disconnection, an exception is thrown.

     * If the remote side disconnects, the local side should still be able to read any remaining bytes that were sent before the disconnection.
